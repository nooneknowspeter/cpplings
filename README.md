# cpplings

cpplings, inspired by Rustlings, are a set of exercises to help get used to reading and writting C++.

The exercises reference [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/), which is an html based book for learning C++,
and a similar project [cpling](https://github.com/rdjondo/cplings)s, which adopted this idea before this project.

It is recommended to do these exercises while reading through [learncpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) and the other resources mentioned below.

## Build

The project uses Zig as a toolchain instead of CMake for experimentation.
Required Zig version: `0.15.0-dev.155+acfdad858`

### Nix

A `nix-shell` has all configurations and dependencies for launching a Nix shell (install Nix through a package manager).
